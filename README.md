Editors is an Eclipse plug-in that adds a view showing all open editors in a vertical list.
You can (optionally) sort the list by Name or Path.

This plug-in is based on [Open Editors by David Bickley](https://github.com/dbickley/OpenEditors), modified and adapted to behave more like the classic [Editor List](http://editorlist.sourceforge.net/) Eclipse plug-in.
